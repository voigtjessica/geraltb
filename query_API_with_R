#API documentation from the UK police: https://data.police.uk/docs/

#Endpoint + path para roubo a casa:  https://data.police.uk/api/crimes-street/burglary?

path <- "https://data.police.uk/api/crimes-street/burglary?"

# Build our API request and submit it
# First we supply the path to the API endpoint and provide search parameters in the form of a list to the query argument. 
# There are three parameters available to us:

request <- GET(url = path, 
               query = list(
                 lat = 53.421813,
                 lng = -2.330251,
                 date = "2018-05"))

#If it was right, the result will be == 200

request$status_code


# Next we parse the content returned from the server as text using the content function.

response <- content(request, as = "text", encoding = "UTF-8")

# Then weâ€™ll parse the JSON content and and convert it to a data frame.

df <- fromJSON(response, flatten = TRUE) %>% 
  data.frame()
