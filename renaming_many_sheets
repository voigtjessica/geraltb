#Example that I once did. 
#I had a list() containing many sheets with diferent headers, I knew the headers pattern, so I did a loop that would rename all the sheets header 
#so I could put them together in one DF.

#lista_lotes : my list with many sheets.
#plyr::rename function you must use first the old name and then the new name.
